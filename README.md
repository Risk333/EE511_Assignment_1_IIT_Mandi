# Image_Preprocessing_with_custom_Functions

1. Load an RGB image of any image format (JPG, PNG, etc.) and size using OpenCV and convert it to a gray image with a resolution of 256x256.
2. Flip the RGB Image horizontally and vertically and display the original and flipped images side-by-side.
3. Perform random crops of 128x128 and rescale it to 256x256. Display the center point and a rectangle of 128x128 on the RGB image and cropped & scaled image side by side.
